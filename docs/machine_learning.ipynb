    "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in Sweden, with over 2 million affected and approximately 30,000 annual deaths.<br>\n",
    "The aim of this project was to use data analysis combined with the machine learning algorithms `GradientBoosting`, `RandomForest`, and `SHAP` in sklearn to investigate which five factors contribute most to CVD, and to use machine learning to predict whether a person has CVD or not.<br>\n",
    "The project analyzed a file with patient data from 70,000 people in twelve different categories: age, height, weight, gender, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol level, glucose level, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity and presence or absence of cardiovascular disease.<br>\n",
    "The five most important risk factors for CVD were identified as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, BMI, age, and cholesterol. The results showed that older people and individuals with higher BMI had an increased risk of CVD, which is consistent with previous research.<br>\n",
    "The machine learning algorithms `GradientBoosting` and `RandomForest` demonstrated a test accuracy of 73.6%, with a better ability to identify CVD cases than non-CVD cases. Data analysis also indicated that there were shortcomings in the representation of different age groups and gender, which may have influenced the results."
