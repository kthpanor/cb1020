    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the course *[Project in Mathematical Modeling (CB1020)](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/CB1020)*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Content\n",
    "\n",
    "The are three focal points in this course namely to obtain (i) a practical experience with the project work form, (ii) a deepened understanding of mathematical methods in biotechnology, and (iii) basic programming skills targeted toward mathematical modeling. \n",

    "Mathematical models are used to rationalize and better understand a wide range of phenomena in biology and biotechnology. We refer to the rich yet far from exhaustive list of examples presented in the book titled *\"Mathematical biology: An introduction with Maple and Matlab\"* by Shonkwiler and Herod {cite}`Shonkwiler2009`, and we will focus on three very different approaches to conduct mathematical modeling namely by means of (i) *ordinary differential equations (ODEs)*, (ii) *agent-based models (ABMs)*, and (iii) *data analysis*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, the programming language in which we implement any given model is of minor importance *per se*. However, it makes good sense for every engineer to be well trained in using at least one versatile and generic programming language. Arguably, Python is a good choice to fill this role and it will therefore be the language of choice in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "You will work in groups with 4–5 members. One person in each group will be randomly selected as group leader. We thus adopt a leadership model that is referred to as hierarchical but with a limited authority given to the project leader in the sense that decisions are made at group meetings (see page 64 in {cite}`Andersen2013`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "Guidelines for communication:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All documents communicated outside the group (to the mentor or peer students) should be marked with date and the names of all contributing team members and shared in the [portable document format (PDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "- All deliverables are to be uploaded to the [Canvas area](https://canvas.kth.se/courses/21301/pages/valkommen-till-bb1220-projekt-i-bioteknik) of the course\n",
    "\n",
    "- All group members should have access to all group documents. Make use of one of the several available technical solutions:\n",
    "\t- [KTH OneDrive](https://intra.kth.se/en/it/dokument/spara-filer-i-molnet/kth-onedrive)\n",
    "\t- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)\n",
    "\t- [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose document tools that are well suited to your needs:\n",
    "\t- [Microsoft Office](https://www.office.com/): the most widespread set of tools \n",
    "\t- [Google Docs, Sheets and Slides](https://www.google.com/docs/about/): intuitive tools allowing for multi-user editing\n",
    "\t- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/): the best choice for equation-loaded documents\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take [minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minutes) from every group meeting and keep them in a separate folder. Minutes should have a record of meeting participants, date, discussions, and every made decision\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every project member should keep a personal log book upon which the reflection document is created in the end (see page 84 in {cite}`Andersen2013`)\n",
