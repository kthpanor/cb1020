    "The are three focus points in this course namely to obtain (i) a practical experience with the project work form, (ii) a deepened understanding of mathematical methods in biotechnology, and (iii) basic programming skills targeted toward mathematical modeling. \n",

    "The *project work form* is omnipresent in industri and academia alike, making it an expected and all but required skill in every engineer. Thus, it makes good sense to develop this skillset already as a student and as a training ground we will use *problem-based learning* in our studies of the cross-disciplinary topic of mathematical modeling. An excellent guide to project work is the book titled *\"Projektarbete: En vägledning för studenter\"* by Andersen and Schwencke {cite}`Andersen2013`. A readthrough of this book is well invested time and will provide genreric, valuable, knowhow for future work.\n",

    "Mathematical models and simulations are used to rationalize and better understand a wide range of phenomena in biology and biotechnology. We will focus on four very different approaches to conduct mathematical modeling:\n",

    "- [machine learning (ML)](sec:ml).\n",

    "In principle, the programming language in which we implement any given model is of minor importance *per se*. However, it makes good sense for every engineer to be well trained in using at least one versatile and generic programming language. Arguably, Python is a good choice to fill this role and it will therefore be the language of choice in this course."
