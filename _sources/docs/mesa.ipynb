    "# Mesa\n",
    "[Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html) is a Python-based framework for agent-based modeling (ABM). It offers built-in core components from which one can quickly setup and customize the implementation of an ABM. Furthermore, Mesa has built-in tools for data collection and analysis of the results obtained from the ABM simulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mesacontains three categories of modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modeling**: Modules used to build the models themselves: a model and agent classes, a scheduler to determine the sequence in which the agents act, and space for them to move around on.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analysis**: Tools to collect data generated from your model, or to run it multiple times with different parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visualization**: Classes to create and launch an interactive model visualization, using a server with a JavaScript interface."
